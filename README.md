Hi, I’m Lisa. 👋
- 🇨🇦 I'm a junior full-stack web developer based in Montreal.
- 👩🏻‍💻 I love creating websites, I'm interested in art + design, and I'm passionate about visual media at large. 
- 📩 I'd love to collaborate on projects, talk about all things web dev, or connect in general: lisamassa.art@gmail.com.
- 🍝 When I'm not coding, I'm either cooking food, out on a run, or making art. 

	Thank you for stopping by! 😁
